# Center with Margin

There are thress elements need to be set when you want to center your components.

1. `display: block` : The components need fully control of the horizontal space so that they can center themselves correctly.
2. must have a width : The componenets need to be set a width or it will display as same size as the browser zoom in or out the windows.
3. `margin-left/right: auto` : `auto` means take all available space, and we have block element, so the available space is all the space that's left or right after the images take up its numbers of pixels.
